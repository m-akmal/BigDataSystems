Group 23 Part C Readme

The directory contains 3 scripts:
    1. PartCQuestion1.sh (Runs Page Rank with Default Partitioning)
    2. PartCQuestion2.sh (Runs Page Rank with Range Partitioning)
    3. PartCQuestion3.sh (Runs Page Rank with Range Partitioning and Memory Persistence)

The Spark Apps are written in Scala.
    1. main/scala/PartCQuestion-1.scala (Runs Page Rank with Default Partitioning)
    2. main/scala/PartCQuestion-2.scala (Runs Page Rank with Range Partitioning)
    3. main/scala/PartCQuestion-3.scala (Runs Page Rank with Range Partitioning and Memory Persistence)

build.sbt : File used by SBT Tool to create Jar of compiled Scala Apps.

Each of the Spark takes 2 argument - HDFS path to datafile and Number of Iterations of PageRank

Important Note/Assumptions:
    1. We have used LeftOuterJoin instead of Join. This change doesn't impact the output of the spark app. Leftouterjoin seems to be faster than Join in our case.
    2. For sink nodes (No referring to any other node), we are keeping the rank as original rank 1.
