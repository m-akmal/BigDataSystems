This prog is derived from exampleMatmulSingle.py
 dimension of the matrix: N = 100000 
 number of splits along one dimension d = 100 

TRICK: Calculate machine for sub-matrix by ((i+j) % 5)
Explanation:
This will place sub-matrtix (i,j) and (j,i) on same host
This placement strategy will reduce shuffle over network
intermediate_traces will store trace for all sub-matrices on each machine

Final Step:
Calculate total trace by summing up all elements from intermediate_traces

Performance:
    Time for completition:
     d=100: 3min 19.717sec
     d=10:  7min 40.646sec
