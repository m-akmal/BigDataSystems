Program Logic:
Graph Construction:
Code reads fromNodeId and toNodeId from source file into datafile variable.
The string line is split into to tuple of srcNodeId and destNodeID

graph - Graph of vertices(unique list of fromNodeid) and edges(list of tuples of node pairs)

outDegrees - calculates out degree for each vertex

runGraph - Joins vertices with their out degrees.

Loop for 20 iterations:
Calculate rank to be transferred to neighbours for each vertex.
Send the calculated amount to each neighbour via sendToDst by looping on each edgeTriplet
Reduce all received rank_updates by summing them and updating current rank for each vertex.


rankGraph.triplets.count actions all the calculations.
